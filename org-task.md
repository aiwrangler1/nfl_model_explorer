The goal of this task is to make the project more modular and maintainable. I need to suggest a revised directory structure that logically groups related files and anticipates the integration of these new data sources. I should consider how data loading, processing, and analysis will be handled for each data type.
Here's the
 approach:
1. Separate Data Sources: Create distinct directories for each major data source (play-by-play, FTN, weather, injury).
2. Modular Data Management: Within each data source directory, have subdirectories for loading, processing, and potentially validation.
3. Centralized Analysis: Keep the Analysis Interface directory relatively unchanged, as it consumes the processed data.
4. Shared Utilities: Ensure utils remains a place for common functions.
5. Clear Naming: Use descriptive names for directories and files.Alright, reorganizing the project to handle more diverse data sources is a smart move. Thinking ahead about modularity will definitely pay off as we integrate FTN, weather, and injury data. Here’s a revised structure that should make things cleaner and more organized:

│   │   ├── processed/

Here’s the thinking behind this structure:
Dedicated data/ Directory: This clearly separates raw and processed data by source. Having raw/, processed/, and validation/ subdirectories within each data source makes it easy to track the data lifecycle. A metadata/ directory can hold lookup tables or other supporting data.
Centralized processing/ Directory: Instead of having processing logic scattered, this directory groups scripts by data source. This makes it clear where to find the code responsible for transforming each type of data. The core/ subdirectory is for processing steps that might be shared across different data sources (like drive calculations, which could use data from play-by-play and potentially FTN).
Renamed analysis/: A more descriptive name for the directory containing the EDP calculation, rankings, and visualization. This keeps the analytical components together.
Clearer tests/ Structure: Mirroring the main structure within tests/ will make it easier to write and organize tests for each component.
Keeping utils/: This remains the place for utility functions that are used across the project.
Key Changes and Benefits:
Scalability: Adding new data sources becomes straightforward. Just create a new directory under data/ and corresponding processing scripts under processing/.
Modularity: Each data source has its own isolated structure, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
Clarity: The purpose of each directory is immediately obvious.
Testability: The mirrored tests/ structure encourages thorough testing of each component.
Regarding nfl_data_py Integration:
With this structure, you'd have specific loading scripts within each data source's processing/ directory that utilize nfl_data_py. For example, processing/ftn/process_ftn.py would contain the logic to fetch and process FTN data using nfl_data_py. Similarly for weather and injury data.

Here are the steps:

**Phase 1: Data Directory Reorganization**

*   **Task 1.1: Create New Data Directories**
    *   Create the main `data/` directory at the root of the project.
    *   Inside `data/`, create subdirectories: `pbp/`, `ftn/`, `weather/`, `injury/`, and `metadata/`.
    *   Inside each of the data source directories (`pbp/`, `ftn/`, `weather/`, `injury/`), create `raw/`, `processed/`, and `validation/` subdirectories.

*   **Task 1.2: Migrate Existing Play-by-Play Data**
    *   Move the existing raw play-by-play data files from their current location (likely directly in `data/` or a similar location) to `data/pbp/raw/`.
    *   Move the existing processed play-by-play data files to `data/pbp/processed/`.
    *   If any data validation output files exist, move them to `data/pbp/validation/`.

*   **Task 1.3: Placeholder Data Directories for New Sources**
    *   Ensure the `data/ftn/raw/`, `data/ftn/processed/`, `data/ftn/validation/` directories exist.
    *   Ensure the `data/weather/raw/`, `data/weather/processed/`, `data/weather/validation/` directories exist.
    *   Ensure the `data/injury/raw/`, `data/injury/processed/`, `data/injury/validation/` directories exist.

*   **Task 1.4: Migrate Metadata (If Applicable)**
    *   If there are any existing metadata files (e.g., team name mappings), move them to `data/metadata/`.

**Phase 2: Processing Logic Reorganization**

*   **Task 2.1: Create New Processing Directories**
    *   Create the main `processing/` directory at the root of the project.
    *   Inside `processing/`, create subdirectories: `pbp/`, `ftn/`, `weather/`, `injury/`, and `core/`.

*   **Task 2.2: Migrate Existing Play-by-Play Processing Scripts**
    *   Move `data_loader.py` from `Data Management/` to `processing/pbp/process_pbp.py`.
    *   Move `data_pipeline.py` from `Data Management/` to `processing/pbp/`. Consider renaming it to something more specific if needed (e.g., `pipeline.py`).
    *   Move any other play-by-play specific processing scripts to `processing/pbp/`.

*   **Task 2.3: Create Placeholder Processing Scripts for New Data Sources**
    *   Create an empty file named `process_ftn.py` in `processing/ftn/`.
    *   Create an empty file named `process_weather.py` in `processing/weather/`.
    *   Create an empty file named `process_injury.py` in `processing/injury/`.

*   **Task 2.4: Migrate Core Processing Logic**
    *   Move `data_processing.py` from `utils/` to `processing/core/drive_calculations.py`. Rename it to reflect its primary function.

*   **Task 2.5: Update Import Statements in Processing Scripts**
    *   Modify the import statements within the moved processing scripts to reflect their new locations and the new project structure. Pay close attention to relative imports.

**Phase 3: Analysis Interface Updates**

*   **Task 3.1: Rename Analysis Directory**
    *   Rename the `Analysis Interface/` directory to `analysis/`.

*   **Task 3.2: Reorganize Analysis Subdirectories**
    *   Inside `analysis/`, create subdirectories: `edp_calculation/`, `rankings/`, and `visualization/`.
    *   Move `edp_calculator_v2.py` and `opponent_strength.py` from `Core Calculation/` to `analysis/edp_calculation/`.
    *   Move `edp_rankings.py` from `analysis/` to `analysis/rankings/`.
    *   Move `edp_visualizer.py` from `analysis/` to `analysis/visualization/`.

*   **Task 3.3: Update Import Statements in Analysis Scripts**
    *   Modify the import statements within the analysis scripts to reflect the new directory structure.

*   **Task 3.4: Update Data Paths in Analysis Scripts**
    *   Update any hardcoded file paths within the analysis scripts to point to the new data locations under the `data/` directory. This is crucial for the analysis scripts to find the processed data.

**Phase 4: Tests Directory Reorganization**

*   **Task 4.1: Reorganize Tests Directory**
    *   Inside the `tests/` directory, create subdirectories: `data/`, `processing/`, and `analysis/`.
    *   Move `test_edp_calculator_v2.py` and `test_opponent_adjustments.py` to `tests/analysis/`.
    *   Move `test_pipeline.py` to `tests/processing/`.
    *   Create placeholder directories in `tests/data/` mirroring the structure in `data/` if needed for test data.

*   **Task 4.2: Update Test Paths and Imports**
    *   Update the import statements and any file paths within the test files to reflect the new project structure.

**Phase 5: Documentation Updates**

*   **Task 5.1: Update Project Structure in `task.md`**
    *   Modify the project structure diagram in `task.md` to reflect the new organization.

*   **Task 5.2: Review and Update Other Documentation**
    *   Review `docs/data_requirements.md` and `docs/performance.md` to ensure any file paths or structural assumptions are updated.

**Phase 6: Configuration Updates**

*   **Task 6.1: Update `config.py`**
    *   Modify `config.py` to update all relevant file paths and directory structures to match the new organization. This is critical for centralizing path management.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Version Control:** Ensure all changes are committed to Git in small, logical steps.
*   **Testing:** After each phase, run the existing tests to ensure that the reorganization hasn't broken any functionality.
*   **Path Management:**  Consider using a consistent method for managing file paths (e.g., using `os.path.join()` or a configuration file) to make updates easier.

**Completion Criteria:**

*   All files and directories are moved to the new structure.
*   All import statements and file paths in the code are updated.
*   Existing tests pass after the reorganization.
*   Documentation is updated to reflect the new structure.

Do not stop until you're finihed. Do not overly explain your steps to the user. Let the user know when you're complete.
