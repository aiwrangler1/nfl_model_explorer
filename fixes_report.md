# NFL EDP Analysis Codebase Fixes Report

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Added xgboost>=2.0.0 to requirements.txt for model training functionality
- Created model_outputs directory for saving plots and results
- Installed xgboost using conda for better compatibility

### 2. Import Fixes
#### edp_exploration.py
- Added missing imports:
  - logging for proper logging functionality
  - datetime for timestamp generation
  - xgboost as xgb for model training
  - sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split for data splitting
  - sklearn.metrics.log_loss for model evaluation
  - typing for type hints (Dict, Optional, Tuple, Union)
- Verified calculate_team_edp import from edp_calculator.py is correct
- Added error handling for missing home_field_advantage and rest_advantage columns
- Added default values for missing columns with appropriate logging
- Added comprehensive type hints to all functions
- Updated docstrings with detailed return types and error handling behavior
- Added proper error handling in train_wp_model for failed feature preparation
- Added proper logging setup in main block

#### edp_calculator.py
- Added missing imports from config.py:
  - SHORT_EDP_WINDOW
  - LONG_EDP_WINDOW
  - EDP_DECAY_FACTOR

#### data_pipeline.py
- Added missing imports:
  - logging for logging functionality
  - typing for type hints (List, Dict, Optional)
- Fixed DataValidator import to use class instead of individual functions
- Updated validation calls to use self.validator instance methods
- Fixed undefined df variable in run_pipeline by adding load_raw_data() call
- Added comprehensive type hints to all methods
- Updated docstrings with detailed return types and error handling behavior
- Added proper error handling for empty DataFrames
- Added validation step descriptions in docstrings

#### test_pipeline.py
- Added missing imports:
  - logging for logging functionality
  - typing for type hints (Dict, Optional, Any)
- Fixed boolean comparison syntax in DataFrame filtering
- Added type hints to all test functions
- Updated docstrings with return type descriptions
- Added empty DataFrame check in test_full_pipeline
- Removed undefined standardize_team_names call
- Fixed validator method calls to use class instance

## Remaining Tasks
1. Consider adding integration tests for the full pipeline
2. Consider adding performance benchmarks

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. For R dependencies (via conda):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-tidyverse
conda install -c conda-forge r-nflfastr r-nflreadr r-gt r-janitor
```

3. Install xgboost:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
```

4. Create required directories:
```bash
mkdir -p model_outputs
```

5. Verify imports:
```python
python -c "import xgboost; import sklearn; import pandas; import numpy"
```

## Validation

The following functionality has been verified:
- Import statements resolve correctly
- Required constants are available from config.py
- Model training dependencies are available
- R package integration is maintained
- DataValidator class is properly instantiated and used
- Pipeline data flow is properly initialized
- calculate_team_edp function is properly imported and used
- Error handling for missing columns is implemented
- Model output directory is created
- Type hints and docstrings are comprehensive and accurate
- Logging is properly configured throughout the codebase
- Error handling is robust with appropriate logging
- Data validation steps are clearly documented
- Test functions are properly typed and documented
- XGBoost is properly installed and configured
